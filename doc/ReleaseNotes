UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from 2.0:

* Please reinstall in a new directory.  Then move your modified
  templates into the new templates/ -directory.  You MUST
  have the default template in place, else things might not
  work.
* Replace jspwiki.properties with your old configuration file.
  It should run unmodified, though you might want to go through
  the new file to see new options.

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

for further information.


KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES
==================

* Documentation needs cleanup; it's out of date, etc.
* ISO-8859-1 and attachments don't always mix
* HTTPS and Internet Explorer don't work in Preview


NOTE ABOUT AUTHENTICATION
=========================

This JSPWiki version includes an unsupported version of Authorization
and Authentication.  AAA was supposed to be the major feature of the
2.2 release, but unfortunately it turned out that the solution chosen
was crappy and the coder (me) did not know what he was doing.  This
dragged the work for the 2.2 release behind for many months, as I was
not really interested in doing it.  So I decided to discard the entire
solution and settle for something simpler.  This work is still
ongoing, and a new solution is being drafted.

The old auth system is still in place, but it is completely deprecated
and largely undocumented.  You may use it if you want, but please do
not report any bugs regarding it.  You can enable it by putting
"jspwiki.auth.useOldAuth=true" in your jspwiki.properties.
