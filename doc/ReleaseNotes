for further information.


NOTE ABOUT AUTHENTICATION
=========================

This JSPWiki version includes an unsupported version of Authorization
and Authentication.  AAA was supposed to be the major feature of the
2.2 release, but unfortunately it turned out that the solution chosen
was crappy and the coder (me) did not know what he was doing.  This
dragged the work for the 2.2 release behind for many months, as I was
not really interested in doing it.  So I decided to discard the entire
solution and settle for something simpler.  This work is still
ongoing, and a new solution is being drafted.

The old auth system is still in place, but it is completely deprecated
and largely undocumented.  You may use it if you want, but please do
not report any bugs regarding it.
