  BUGS

  - if a wikilink is added to a page, then removed, RefMan still thinks that
    the page refers to the wikilink page. Hm.

  - if a page is deleted, gets very confused.

  - Serialization causes page attributes to be missing, when InitializablePlugins
    are not executed properly.  Thus, serialization should really also mark whether
    a page is serializable or not...
 */


/* 
   A word about synchronizing:
   
   I expect this object to be accessed in three situations:
   - when a WikiEngine is created and it scans its wikipages
   - when the WE saves a page
   - when a JSP page accesses one of the WE's ReferenceManagers 
     to display a list of (un)referenced pages.

   So, access to this class is fairly rare, and usually triggered by 
   user interaction. OTOH, the methods in this class use their storage
   objects intensively (and, sorry to say, in an unoptimized manner =).
   My deduction: using unsynchronized HashMaps etc and syncing methods
   or code blocks is preferrable to using slow, synced storage objects.
   We don't have iterative code here, so I'm going to use synced methods
   for now.
   
   Please contact me if you notice problems with ReferenceManager, and
   especially with synchronization, or if you have suggestions about
   syncing.

/**
 *  Keeps track of wikipage references:
 *  <UL>
 *  <LI>What pages a given page refers to
 *  <LI>What pages refer to a given page
 *  </UL>
 *
 *  This is a quick'n'dirty approach without any finesse in storage and
 *  searching algorithms; we trust java.util.*.
 *  <P>
 *  This class contains two HashMaps, m_refersTo and m_referredBy. The 
 *  first is indexed by WikiPage names and contains a Collection of all
 *  WikiPages the page refers to. (Multiple references are not counted,
 *  naturally.) The second is indexed by WikiPage names and contains 
 *  a Set of all pages that refer to the indexing page. (Notice - 
 *  the keys of both Maps should be kept in sync.)
 *  <P>
 *  When a page is added or edited, its references are parsed, a Collection
 *  is received, and we crudely replace anything previous with this new
 *  Collection. We then check each referenced page name and make sure they
 *  know they are referred to by the new page.
 *  <P>
 *  Based on this information, we can perform non-optimal searches for 
 *  e.g. unreferenced pages, top ten lists, etc.
 *  <P>
 *  The owning class must take responsibility of filling in any pre-existing
 *  information, probably by loading each and every WikiPage and calling this
 *  class to update the references when created.
