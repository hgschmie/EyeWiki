/**
 * FormSet is a companion WikiPlugin for Form. 
 * 
 * <p>The mandatory 'form' parameter specifies which form the variable
 * applies to.  Any other parameters are put directly into a FormInfo
 * object that will be available to a Form plugin called 'form'
 * (presumably invoked later on the same WikiPage).
 * 
 * <p>If the name of a FormSet parameter is the same as the name of
 * a Form plugin input element later on the same page, the Form will
 * consider the given value the default for the form field. (However,
 * the handler for the Form is free to use the value as it wishes, and
 * even override it.)
 *
 * <p>If the name of a parameter is not present in Form input fields,
 * the parameter is presumably meant for sending initial information
 * to the Form handler. If this is the case, you may want to specify the
 * <i>populate=''</i> in the Form <i>open</i> element, otherwise the
 * form won't be displayed on the first invocation.
 *  
 * <p>This object looks for a FormInfo object named
 * FORM_VALUES_CARRIER in the WikiContext. If found, it checks that
 * its name matches the 'form' parameter, and if it does, adds the
 * plugin parameters to the FormInfo. If the names don't match, the
 * old FormInfo is discarded and a new one is created. Only one
 * FormInfo is supported at a time. A practical consequence of this is
 * that a FormSet invocation only applies to the Form plugins that
 * follow it; any further Forms need new FormSet calls.
