Allows you to define a link to a page which you are denouncing.  In practice, this means that any normal user agent (like Mozilla or Firebird or IE) will see the link as intended, but any search engine will not see the link, and thus cannot index it.

This has the effect that you can point to a page, but search engines will not increase its rank.  For example, if you see a terrible page that shows how to do nasty things to kittens, you can link to it and say "how horrible", but the search engines will not see your link as an endorsement of that link.

!Parameters

* __link__ = The URL you are referring to
* __text__ = The link text.

!Example

{{{
I don't like this [{Denounce link='http://www.google.com' text='search engine'}].
}}}
would produce:

I don't like this [{Denounce link='http://www.google.com' text='search engine'}].

!Notes

If you are caching your pages in any way, note that it's possible for the search engine to receive the link, too.

!Configuration

All configuration is kept in the JSPWiki.jar -archive, in a file called com/ecyrd/jspwiki/plugin/denounce.properties.  You can take it out, modify at will, and put it in classes/com/ecyrd/jspwiki/plugin, if you want.
