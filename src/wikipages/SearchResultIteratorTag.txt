Iterates over a set of search results, with the top scoring result on top.

A "SearchResult" object has the following methods:

* WikiPage getPage() - Gets the current WikiPage
* int getScore() - Returns the score.  The score is an arbitrary number, which does not necessarily mean
  anything, except that the best match should always have the highest score.
