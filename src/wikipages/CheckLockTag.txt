!Usage

<wiki:CheckLock mode="locked|unlocked|owned" id="<variable>">
;:''content''
</wiki:CheckLock>

!Parameters

;__mode__: If set to "locked", will include the content if the page has been locked.  If set to "o
wned", will include only if the page is locked by the current user.  Value "unlocked" includes if
the page is not locked.

!Example
{{{
      <wiki:CheckLock mode="locked" id="lock">
         <P CLASS="locknote">User '<%=lock.getLocker()%>' has started to edit this page, but has not yet
         saved.  I won't stop you from editing this page anyway, BUT be aware that
         the other person might be quite annoyed.  It would be courteous to wait for his lock
         to expire or until he stops editing the page.  The lock expires in
         <%=lock.getTimeLeft()%> minutes.
         </P>
      </wiki:CheckLock>
}}}
