Sometimes you want to run multiple Wiki instances, for example one for each project you're managing.  The projects have different members and different requirements; perhaps even different access rules.

Here's how you set up multiple wiki-instances:

Let us say that your main wiki instance is called ~GobbleWiki, because your company is called "Gobble Inc", and this is your intranet.  You are using Tomcat, and you have installed it in /opt/tomcat.  You have already set up the ~GobbleWiki directory, and customized your jspwiki.properties.

Now, you have a new project called "Zorp", and you want to establish a "~ZorpWiki" for it.  Do as follows:

Put the following in the /opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml file, within your {{{<Host>}}} -section.

{{{
     <Context path="/ZorpWiki" docBase="GobbleWiki.war" debug="0">
          <Parameter name="jspwiki.propertyfile" value="/opt/tomcat/conf/ZorpWiki.properties"
                     override="false"/>
     </Context>
}}}

Take a copy of the {{GobbleWiki/WEB-INF/jspwiki.properties}} -file, and put it in {{/opt/tomcat/conf/ZorpWiki.properties}}.  Then edit it at will.  You definitely want to change the following properties (at least):

* jspwiki.applicationName
* jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir (or whichever provider you're using)
* jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir (or whichever provider you're using)
* jspwiki.baseURL
* log4j.appender.~FileLog.File (if you're using log4j file logger)

Restart Tomcat.

!Upgrading to new version of JSPWiki

Just drop the new "JSPWiki.war" into place as "~GobbleWiki.war".  The ~ZorpWiki should then be automatically able to pick it up.
