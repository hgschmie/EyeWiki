Creates a weblog archive. It essentially consists of a list that contains hyperlinks to different parts of the archive.

JSPWiki does not keep weblog archives as such, but they are all generated on-the-fly, dynamically.

The [Weblog Archive Plugin] does not generate entries for months that do not have a weblog entry.

!Parameters

* __page__ = The page on which the weblog resides.  If not defined, uses the current page.

!Example

{{{
__Archive:__\\
[{WeblogArchivePlugin}]
}}}

might generate something like this:

__Archive:__\\
__2003 AD__\\
[January|Main]\\
[February|Main]\\
[March|Main]

!About the generated HTML

The list that is created is essentially an HTML ul -list.  The generated HTML for the above example might look like this:
{{{
<div class="weblogarchive">
  <ul>
    <li class="archiveyear">2003</li>
    <li><a href="...">January</a></li>
    <li><a href="...">February</a></li>
    <li><a href="...">March</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
}}}

The look-and-feel of what it actually looks like on the browser is achieved through the magic of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

If you wonder where the "AD" comes from, it's been defined in the style sheet file, as a cute example on how to use the :after -pseudoelement.
