!Usage

{{{
<wiki:UserCheck status="unknown|known|named|validated|unvalidated">
   JSP or HTML content
</wiki:UserCheck>
}}}

!Parameters

;__status__: Is used to determine if the user has logged in or what.  See below.

The possible values of "status" are:

* "unknown"     - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is completely unknown (no cookie, no password)
* "known"       - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is not unknown (i.e has a cookie, 
                  or has been authenticated.
* "named"       - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user has either been named by a cookie, but
                  not been authenticated.
* "validated"   - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is validated either through the container,
                  or by our own authentication.
* "unvalidated" - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is not validated (i.e. he could have a cookie,
                  but has not been authenticated.)

In 2.0 there was an attribute called "exists".  This is now deprecated, but it is still recognized.  See below.

!Example
{{{
    <wiki:UserCheck status="known">
        G'day,<wiki:UserName />
    </wiki:UserCheck>

    <wiki:UserCheck status="unknown">
        Set your name in <wiki:LinkTo page="UserPreferences">UserPreferences</wiki:LinkTo>
    </wiki:UserCheck>
}}}

Displays a greeting, if the user has either set a cookie or logged in; else displays a link to the page UserPreferences.

!Notes

The behavior of this tag was significantly enhanced in 2.2.  The old tag had the parameter "exists", which corresponds to the status parameter as follows:

__OLD__
{{{
<wiki:UserCheck exists="true">
}}}
Replace with
{{{
<wiki:UserCheck status="known">
}}}

__OLD__
{{{
<wiki:UserCheck exists="false">
}}}
Replace with
{{{
<wiki:UserCheck status="unknown">
}}}
