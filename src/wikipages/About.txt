iWiki is a branch of the [JSPWiki|http://www.jspwiki.org/] code base.

[Janne Jalkanen|http://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly/] deserves full credit
for the original JSP Wiki code and the hard work that he put into it.

We still sync with his original code base from time to time.

The code for this Wiki is placed under the [GNU Lesser General Public
License|http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html], just like the
original JSPWiki itself.
