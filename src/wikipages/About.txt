I created this Wiki because I couldn't find a Wiki that did
exactly what I wanted.  I needed a Wiki where I could put my own
code tricks for easy dispersal.

This Wiki is done using [JSP|http://java.sun.com/products/jsp] technology, 
which hopefully makes it very easy to keep up to date and looking better than most of the Wikis based on the [original one|http://c2.com/cgi/wiki].  A custom bean handles the translation of text into HTML.

Most of the [editing markers|TextFormattingRules] have been styled according to the [Sensei's Library|http://senseis.xmp.net], the best Go sites in the Internet.  I find their markup very easy, yet clear.

Unlike most Wikis, not everyone can edit this.  You need a user account/password if you want to contribute.  This is mainly done because I don't want to lose any data...

If you have any ideas or wish to participate, please [contact me|mailto:jalkanen+jspwiki@ecyrd.com].
