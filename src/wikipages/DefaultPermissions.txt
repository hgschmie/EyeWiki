This page contains default permissions for this Wiki.  You use it by setting the variable "defaultpermissions" on the page, and using the standard notation, and separating the permissions using a semicolon (;).  Note that this only works in the case you are keeping the wiki permissions on the page, using the included [PageAuthorizer] module.

Some examples follow.

The blanket permission "edit" always implies also upload and commenting permissions.
