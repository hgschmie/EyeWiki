Finds and lists all pages that refer to the current page.

!Parameters 

;__max__=''n'' : How many pages to list.  Default is 10. Some pages might create very long lists, so it's a good idea to limit the list size.
;__extras__='''...and %d more.''' : How to show entries after ''max''. %d is replaced by the remaining number of pages.
;__maxwidth__=''n'' : Limits the length of the generated links to at most ''n'' characters.  This should used to keep the [LeftMenu] or [LeftMenuFooter] at a manageable width.  Default is to not limit the length at all.
;__before__='''*''' : This element goes before each generated link. The value is WikiText, and the default is empty. 
;__separator__=''',''' : Sets the separator to use between generated links. The value is WikiText, and the default is a nothing (Change to ", " for a horizontal, comma-separated list.)
;__after__='''\n''' : Sets the separator to use after each generated links. The value is WikiText, and the default is a linebreak, which produces a vertical list. 
;__page__=''pagename'': What pages refer to the given page, not the page this plugin is part of

!Default
The default behavior is to produce a vertical list of links.  Text appearing after the plugin will start on a new line. 

!Examples

For linebreak use 
;:{{{\\\\}}} (four slashes)\\\
For new line use 
;:{{{\n}}}

;The format of the list is: ''Before'' Item1 ''After Separator Before'' Item2 ''After Separator Before'' Item3 ''After''

A comma separated list:
;:{{{ [{ReferringPagesPlugin separator=', ' }] }}}
A bullet list
;:{{{ [{ReferringPagesPlugin before='*' after='\n' }] }}}
;:Before each link put a start list, after each link end the line and start a new line.  Remember, the * must be the first character on the line.
Elements in bold with each one on a new line
;:{{{[{ReferringPagesPlugin before='__' after='__\\\\'}]}}}
Show the first three and a nice message saying there are more.
;:{{{[{ReferringPagesPlugin separator=', ' max=3 extras=' along with %d more that are not shown. '}]}}}
