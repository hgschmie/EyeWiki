Finds and lists all pages that refer to the current page.

!Parameters 

* __max__=''n'' : How many pages to list.  Default is 10. Some pages might create very long lists, so it's a good idea to limit the list size.
* __extras__='''...and %d more.''' : How to show entries after ''max''. %d is replaced by the remaining number of pages.
* __maxwidth__=''n'' : Limits the length of the generated links to at most ''n'' characters.  This should used to keep the [LeftMenu] or [LeftMenuFooter] at a manageable width.  Default is to not limit the length at all.
* __separator__=''',''' : Sets the separator to use between generated links. The value is WikiText, and the default is a linebreak, which produces a vertical list. (Change to ", " for a horizontal, comma-separated list.)
