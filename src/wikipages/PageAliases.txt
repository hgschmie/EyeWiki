Sometimes it's useful to have one page ''really'' mean some other page.  For example, you might have a page called "Page Aliases", but you would also like people to have it available under "Aliases".  In such a case, you can use a "page alias":

Put the following on the "[Aliases]" -page:  (We have an example page there, so if you click on it, you will be returned back here.)

{{{
[{SET alias='PageAliases'}]
}}}

Every time someone views the page "Aliases", they will be automatically redirected to this page.  This is very useful if you want to be able to use the irregular plural forms, for example.  Normally, JSPWiki does recognize english language plural forms of pages properly, but it's not smart enough to recognize certain forms, such as "aliases".

!General redirection

It's also possible to redirect any page to some other page.  The system administrator can set the "jspwiki.specialPage" -redirect from jspwiki.properties, but by setting:

{{{
[{SET redirect='http://www.jspwiki.org'}]
}}}

on a page, any visits to that page will be promptly redirected to "www.jspwiki.org".

!Editing the alias/redirect pages

Well, obviously you cannot click on the "Edit this page" -link, because you are redirected every time you try to view a page.  You can, however, edit the page directly by just writing {{Edit.jsp?page=''pagename''}} after the base url.
