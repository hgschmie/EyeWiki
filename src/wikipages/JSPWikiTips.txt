!!Editing the menu on the left hand side

The menu on the left hand side (over there <--) is just a standard Wiki page, called [LeftMenu].

If you (the administrator) don't want anyone else to modify it, you can always edit [LeftMenu], then make the page read-only on the hard drive itself ;-).

The lower part of the left hand side is similarly called [LeftMenuFooter], and it is fully editable as well.

!!Editing pages directly

By setting up an InterWiki link called "Edit" in {{jspwiki.properties}} you can make direct edit links.  For example, this link here (assuming you're using the default configuration from the JSPWiki archive), will take you
to the edit mode of this page: [Edit:JSPWikiTips].

The magical incantation in the {{jspwiki.properties}} file is:
{{{
jspwiki.interWikiRef.Edit = Edit.jsp?page=%s
}}}

!!How do I enable the [RSS|http://blogspace.com/rss/] feed?

In your jspwiki.properties -file, you'll need to set the "jspwiki.rss.generate" to "true", and also set the "jspwiki.baseURL" to point at your Wiki.  Otherwise the RSS generator can't figure out how its links should go... :-)

!!I don't like ThingsSquashedTogether in the page titles.  What can I do?

As Finns say, "voe tokkiinsa", meaning "yes, of course".  Just set the "jspwiki.breakTitleWithSpaces" property to "true" in your jspwiki.properties-file.

!!Bookmarklets

Bookmarlets are tiny javascript programs stored in a url. (more [here|http://www.bookmarklets.com/tools/categor.html])

They either live 
* in your browser link toolbar, or
* in html pages.

To use bookmarklets in jspwiki pages, you first need to add a javascript interWikiRef in ''jspwiki.properties'':
{{{
#  javascript, for bookmarklets
jspwiki.interWikiRef.javascript= javascript:%s
}}}

You can now start inserting bookmarklets into your page :

!Ex 1 : search in this JSPWiki
{{{
[search here for...|javascript:location.href='http:Search.jsp?query='+
escape(prompt('search for..',''))+'&ok=Find%21'] 
}}}

!Ex 2 : Calculator
{{{
[calculator|javascript:expr=prompt('Formula...(eg:  2*3)','');if(expr){with(Math){evl=parseFloat(eval(expr))};
if(isNaN(evl)){alert('Not a number!')}else{void(prompt('Result:',evl))}}else{void(null)}]
}}}

(Everything on one line, of course).

!Ex 3 : is the current page url already stored in the JSPWiki?

Adapt (for ''your'' wiki) this url, and store it in a new url, in your browser toolbar.
{{{
javascript:location.href='http://localhost:8080/JSPWiki207/Search.jsp?query='
+escape(location.href)+'&ok=Find%21'
}}}

!!I have a question you have not answered!

Well, the easiest thing to do is go directly to the [JSPWiki main site|JSPWiki:Main] and ask your question there.  Or you could also [email me|About], but it's better for all if you go and publicly post your query.  It does not hurt to take a peek at JSPWiki site anyway, since your question might already be answered there...
